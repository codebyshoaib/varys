# Code Review Excellence

Transform code reviews from gatekeeping to knowledge sharing through constructive feedback, systematic analysis, and collaborative improvement.

## When to Use This Skill

- Reviewing pull requests and code changes
- Establishing code review standards for teams
- Mentoring junior developers through reviews
- Conducting architecture reviews
- Creating review checklists and guidelines
- Improving team collaboration
- Reducing code review cycle time
- Maintaining code quality standards

## Core Principles

### 1. The Review Mindset

**Goals of Code Review:**

- Catch bugs and edge cases
- Ensure code maintainability
- Share knowledge across team
- Enforce coding standards
- Improve design and architecture
- Build team culture

**Not the Goals:**

- Show off knowledge
- Nitpick formatting (use linters)
- Block progress unnecessarily
- Rewrite to your preference

### 2. Effective Feedback

**Good Feedback is:**

- Specific and actionable
- Educational, not judgmental
- Focused on the code, not the person
- Balanced (praise good work too)
- Prioritized (critical vs nice-to-have)

```markdown
❌ Bad: "This is wrong."
✅ Good: "This could cause a race condition when multiple users
access simultaneously. Consider using a mutex here."

❌ Bad: "Why didn't you use X pattern?"
✅ Good: "Have you considered the Repository pattern? It would
make this easier to test. Here's an example: [link]"

❌ Bad: "Rename this variable."
✅ Good: "[nit] Consider `userCount` instead of `uc` for
clarity. Not blocking if you prefer to keep it."
```

### 3. Review Scope

**What to Review:**

- Logic correctness and edge cases
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance implications
- Test coverage and quality
- Error handling
- Documentation and comments
- API design and naming
- Architectural fit

**What Not to Review Manually:**

- Code formatting (use Prettier, Black, etc.)
- Import organization
- Linting violations
- Simple typos

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Context Gathering (2-3 minutes)

```markdown
Before diving into code, understand:

1. Read PR description and linked issue
2. Check PR size (>400 lines? Ask to split)
3. Review CI/CD status (tests passing?)
4. Understand the business requirement
5. Note any relevant architectural decisions
```

### Phase 2: High-Level Review (5-10 minutes)

```markdown
1. **Architecture & Design**
   - Does the solution fit the problem?
   - Are there simpler approaches?
   - Is it consistent with existing patterns?
   - Will it scale?

2. **File Organization**
   - Are new files in the right places?
   - Is code grouped logically?
   - Are there duplicate files?

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Are there tests?
   - Do tests cover edge cases?
   - Are tests readable?
```

### Phase 3: Line-by-Line Review (10-20 minutes)

```markdown
For each file:

1. **Logic & Correctness**
   - Edge cases handled?
   - Off-by-one errors?
   - Null/undefined checks?
   - Race conditions?

2. **Security**
   - Input validation?
   - SQL injection risks?
   - XSS vulnerabilities?
   - Sensitive data exposure?

3. **Performance**
   - N+1 queries?
   - Unnecessary loops?
   - Memory leaks?
   - Blocking operations?

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear variable names?
   - Functions doing one thing?
   - Complex code commented?
   - Magic numbers extracted?
```

### Phase 4: Summary & Decision (2-3 minutes)

```markdown
1. Summarize key concerns
2. Highlight what you liked
3. Make clear decision:
   - ✅ Approve
   - 💬 Comment (minor suggestions)
   - 🔄 Request Changes (must address)
4. Offer to pair if complex
```

## Review Techniques

### Technique 1: The Checklist Method

```markdown
## Security Checklist

- [ ] User input validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterization
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checked
- [ ] Secrets not hardcoded
- [ ] Error messages don't leak info

## Performance Checklist

- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] Database queries indexed
- [ ] Large lists paginated
- [ ] Expensive operations cached
- [ ] No blocking I/O in hot paths

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Happy path tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error cases tested
- [ ] Test names are descriptive
- [ ] Tests are deterministic
```

### Technique 2: The Question Approach

Instead of stating problems, ask questions to encourage thinking:

```markdown
❌ "This will fail if the list is empty."
✅ "What happens if `items` is an empty array?"

❌ "You need error handling here."
✅ "How should this behave if the API call fails?"

❌ "This is inefficient."
✅ "I see this loops through all users. Have we considered
the performance impact with 100k users?"
```

### Technique 3: Suggest, Don't Command

Use collaborative language and offer alternatives rather than mandating changes.

### Technique 4: Differentiate Severity

```markdown
Use labels to indicate priority:

🔴 [blocking] - Must fix before merge
🟡 [important] - Should fix, discuss if disagree
🟢 [nit] - Nice to have, not blocking
💡 [suggestion] - Alternative approach to consider
📚 [learning] - Educational comment, no action needed
🎉 [praise] - Good work, keep it up!
```

## Language-Specific Patterns

### Python Code Review

Watch for: mutable default arguments, bare `except:` clauses, mutable class attributes shared across instances.

### TypeScript/JavaScript Code Review

Watch for: `any` types, unhandled async errors, prop mutation in React components.

## Advanced Review Patterns

- **Architectural Review**: Design doc first for large features; review in stages.
- **Test Quality Review**: Tests should describe behavior, not implementation details.
- **Security Review**: Auth checks, input validation, parameterized queries, no hardcoded secrets.

## Giving Difficult Feedback

Use Context + Specific Issue + Helpful Solution instead of praise sandwiches. When there is disagreement: seek to understand, acknowledge valid points, provide data, escalate if needed, and know when to let go.

## Best Practices

1. Review Promptly: within 24 hours, ideally same day
2. Limit PR Size: 200-400 lines max
3. Review in Time Blocks: 60 minutes max, take breaks
4. Automate What You Can: linters, formatters, security scans
5. Build Rapport: emoji, praise, and empathy matter

## PR Review Comment Template

```markdown
## Summary
[Brief overview of what was reviewed]

## Strengths
- [What was done well]

## Required Changes
🔴 [Blocking issue 1]

## Suggestions
💡 [Improvement 1]

## Verdict
✅ Approve after addressing required changes
```
